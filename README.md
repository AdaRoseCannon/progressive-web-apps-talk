## Introduction

I'm Ada Edwards from the Financial Times, I'm here to talk about Progressive Web Apps.

## What is a progressive web app?

* A progressive web app is a type of website which exhibits certain properties.

(Mind map slide)

* **Offline first** - The app must be capable of starting offline and still display useful information. With no No ‘browser-like’ elements or page loading behaviour
* **An icon on the homescreen** - some browsers will prompt for this if it fulfills certain conditions others will not.
* **Responsive** - Perfectly filling the screen, These sites are primarily aimed at mobile and tablets so will need to respond to the plethera of screen sizes. They should also just work as desktop websites too.
* **Touch capable** - An interface designed for touch with Gesture interaction
* **On the open web** - Not locked in to any browser or app store.
