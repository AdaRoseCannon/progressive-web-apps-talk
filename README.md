## Introduction

I'm Ada Edwards from the Financial Times, I'm here to talk about Progressive Web Apps.

## What is a progressive web app?

* A progressive web app is a type of website which exhibits certain properties.

(Mind map slide)

* **Offline first** - The app must be capable of starting offline and still display useful information.
* **Responsive** - These sites are primarily aimed at mobile and tablets so will need to respond to the plethera of screen sizes. They should also just work as desktop websites too.
* **Launched from home screen,** some browsers will prompt for this if it fulfills certain conditions others will not.

## Are they new?

 * Progressive Web Apps are not new.
